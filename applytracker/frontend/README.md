## 💡 What is ApplyTrack?

ApplyTrack is a personal job application tracking app built for students, freshers, and anyone actively searching for a job.

When you're applying to 20, 30, or even 50 companies at the same time — things get messy fast. You forget where you applied, miss follow ups, lose HR contact details, and have no idea what your success rate looks like.

**ApplyTrack fixes all of that in one clean, simple app.**

## 😤 The Problem It Solves

Imagine this — you applied to 30 companies last month.

- You don't remember which ones replied
- You lost the HR's phone number
- You missed following up with 5 companies
- You have no idea how many interviews you got vs rejections

Sound familiar? That's exactly why ApplyTrack exists.
